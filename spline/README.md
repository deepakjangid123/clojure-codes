# spline

Spline (from Spark lineage) project helps people get insight into data processing performed by Apache Spark.
This app makes two DataSets from csv files, appplies inner join on those DataSets and finally write that joined DataSet into a separate csv file.
This whole process is captured by Spline and stored in configured mongoDB, so that process can be seen on the Spline Web UI.
